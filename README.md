# Expense Tracker

Hey people! In this React JS project I created an expense tracker
to track a record of expenses a person made in a given year.
This project also shows a graphical representation of expenses made
in each month of the year.


## Deployment

To deploy this project just simply downlaod the folder and open in
any code editor and run the following command in the terminal.

```bash
  npm start
```
OR we can use npm package nodemon so that everytime any save is hit the server restarts automatically.
